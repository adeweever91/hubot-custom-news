The group implored him to call a special session to expand state healthcare coverage, saying more than 280,000 in Tennessee would receive healthcare if Medicaid was expanded. Haslam's office told the Tennessean he was out of town when the sit-in occurred and declined to comment. Ellen McPherson, 75, was one of the 11 arrested last week. The former nurse says she believes the refusal to expand Medicaid is a moral issue. "It hurts my heart that they won't call a special session to expand Medicaid," she says. "It would mean so much to these people. It doesn't seem fair that the legislatures are covered with insurance but they won't cover all these people."

      <description>Hundreds of bills are filed when the Tennessee legislature revs up at the first of the year. And dozens of them attract attention — sometimes from around the country. But this year, most of those headline-grabbing proposals quietly fizzled out. WPLN’s statehouse reporter Chas Sisk joins Blake Farmer to walk through what happened to some of them.</description>

      <description>A proposal meant to give lawmakers more opportunities to override vetoes of controversial legislation could be tripped up by a separate measure that would dramatically increase how much money state senators can raise. The dispute between the Tennessee House of Representatives and the state Senate could come to a showdown as lawmakers wrap up this year's legislative session.</description>

      <description>The tradition of writing liturgical music began centuries ago, when the main employer of European composers was the Christian church. Since then, an abundance of music has been created to commemorate the Biblical events leading up to the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus. Composers approach musical retellings of Christianity's most important holiday from a variety of perspectives; here are just a few pieces to listen to during Holy Week:</description>

      <description>Lawmakers have again rejected a proposal to offer in-state tuition to undocumented students who graduate from Tennessee high schools. The plan was debated for the second time in three years, and there had been some signs it might have a chance of passing. But skeptics say they're still unwilling to extend any benefits to people who came to the U.S. illegally, even children.</description>

      <description>Congressman Jim Cooper is doubtful that the missile strike on a Syrian air base Thursday night will have much affect, saying the barrage of Tomahawks were "little more than a pin prick." "Syria has many military bases, and this is just more of a beginning of an effort than an end of an effort," the Nashville Democrat tells WPLN. "We tiptoe into these other struggles because it makes somebody feel good to push a button and have an explosion on TV. This is not the way to conduct military or foreign policy."</description>
