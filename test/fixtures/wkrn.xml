				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>LAWRENCEBURG, Tenn. (WKRN) – A former Tennessee police officer is accused of pawning two department-issued weapons.</p>
<p>Robert Jason Gann was indicted on charges of theft and official misconduct, according to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, <a href="http://wkrn.com/2017/04/13/tbi-investigates-missing-firearm-from-tennessee-police-department/" target="_blank">which confirmed it was investigating a missing firearm last week.</a></p>
<p>Agents began investigating Gann on Jan. 23. Since then, they reportedly developed information that he pawned two department-issued guns while working at the Waynesboro Police Department.</p>
<p>He allegedly pawned the weapons in Lawrenceburg on several occasions. The TBI says the final time he pawned a handgun, he didn’t pick it up and it was reportedly sold by the pawn shop.</p>
<p>According to a press release, Gann resigned from his job with the police department before information about the incident surfaced. He then took a job with the Wayne County Sheriff’s Department.</p>
<p>The TBI says his he was fired when the sheriff’s department learned of the allegations against him.</p>
<p>On March 30, the Wayne County Grand Jury returned indictments, charging the Iron City man with one count of theft and four counts of official misconduct.</p>
<p>He was arrested Gann Monday and booked him into the Wayne County jail on $15,000 bond.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=wkrn.com&#038;blog=77997908&#038;post=401624&#038;subd=mgtvwkrn&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>MURFREESBORO, Tenn. (WKRN) &#8211; A man was hoping to win it big over the weekend when he stole several lottery tickets from a Murfreesboro business.</p>
<p>Police will most likely be checking to see if the same man could be responsible for stealing tickets from several other stores in the city over the past few days.</p>
<p>The suspect was captured on surveillance driving up the Smoke &amp; Brew on East Main Street in what appears to be a Ford Explorer Sport Trac pickup. He gets out of the vehicle with what police later find out to be a crowbar.</p>
<p>The man goes straight for the electric meter in the rear of the building, cuts the wire, and the power to the business shuts off.</p>
<p>“The screen goes black and then he comes around the back and tries to pry open the backdoor with a crowbar,” said clerk Megan Ruck.</p>

<p>The suspect then comes around to the front of the store and breaks out the glass door.</p>
<p>“He comes in and throws our register on the ground, he steals a couple of lottery tickets, and some packs of cigarettes and then he’s out,” Ruck told News 2.</p>
<p>The suspect was looking to win it big. He went after the $30 Mighty Jumbo Bucks lottery tickets with potential winnings up to $3 million.</p>
<p>“It’s very hard to get away with stealing lottery tickets; it’s basically pointless to steal a lottery ticket and try to cash it out,” the clerk said.</p>
<p>That’s because each lottery ticket has a tracking number, and lottery officials know what store the tickets are issued to and where they are cashed in.</p>
<p>“You are stealing from the state of Tennessee as well as students and things like that that get scholarship off of these, and people that pay ‘em and, you know, you’re losing a chance if it’s a million-dollar winner. It’s no winning for you because they are stolen,” Ruck explained.</p>

<p>Store workers said the suspect left two crossbars behind, one at the back door and the other one at the front. He also left behind a torn lottery ticket.</p>
<p>Ironically, over the past week, someone stole lottery tickets from at least four other Murfreesboro businesses, reaching around the counter while the clerk was busy or assisting customers.</p>
<p>That’s why folks at Smoke &amp; Brew have been leaving up the photo of the suspect who stole from them so everyone can see.</p>
<p>“Hopefully we’ll get him caught, get him off the streets, you know, before he harms somebody else if he wants to come in and use a weapon on somebody,” Ruck said.</p>
<p>Again, according to incident report the man was driving a maroon Ford Explorer Sport Trac pickup in the most recent lottery ticket heist. If you recognize the vehicle or have any information that could be helpful, please call Crime Stoppers at <strong>615-893-STOP.</strong></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=wkrn.com&#038;blog=77997908&#038;post=401602&#038;subd=mgtvwkrn&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WKRN) &#8211; At least two homes were burglarized over the holiday weekend as homeowners slept inside.</p>
<p>The burglaries happened between 2 a.m. and 4:30 a.m. on Sunday on Alvin Sperry Road near the Wilson-Davidson County line.</p>
<p>“It is very quiet, very green, and very neighborly,” homeowner Barbara Edwards said. “We have lots of family in this area, and we never would have thought anything would happen.”</p>
<p>Edwards and her husband were asleep when someone got into their home using a key they found in one of the couple’s unlocked cars parked outside.</p>
<p>The burglar rummaged through items a few feet from where the couple slept, but they did not wake up.</p>
<p>“When I got up, I saw my purse was spilled out in one of the living room chairs,” she said. “We got to looking around and they hadn’t taken anything but a Bluetooth speaker and the keys to one of our cars.”</p>
<p>Down the street from the Edwards’ home, the burglar got into another neighbor’s home through an open window.</p>

<p>In that case, the homeowner woke up around 4 a.m. and saw a person walking to a four-door car down the street. The homeowner could not give a description since it was so dark.</p>
<p>When the man checked his house, he found that several items, including car keys, were gone, as well as an archery bow.</p>
<p>Metro police took fingerprints from both homes and are working to see if they match fingerprints already on file.</p>
<p>Edwards told News 2 that Sunday afternoon neighbors met to discuss starting a neighborhood watch group, social media page, and adding security to their properties.</p>
<p>“The material thing is not what bothers me,” Edwards explained. “It is just what could have happened.”</p>
<p>She continued, “Don&#8217;t be naïve. Make sure you lock your cars, have alarm systems, have a camera, have motion detectors for lights on the outside.”</p>
<p>Neighbors had motion activated lights and another neighbor was awoken by his dogs barking outside. Edwards said the responding police officer told her it may have kept the burglar from trying to break into those homes.</p>

<p>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WKRN) – There’s new information Monday in a carjacking and robbery from over the weekend.<a href="http://wkrn.com/2017/04/15/2-robbed-at-gunpoint-carjacked-in-edgehill/" target="_blank"> It happened in the 1500 block of Villa Place</a> in the Edgehill neighborhood.</p>

<p>He is now waiting to learn how badly the suspects damaged his car but is grateful to be alive.</p>
<p>Neighbors say the news of Saturday’s crime spread quickly through the Edgehill area. They told News 2 they are concerned crime is a growing problem.</p>
<p>“In the past month, I have heard of probably four different incidents, of people being robbed on this street,” said Vanessa Schilling, who lives near where the carjacking and robbery happened.</p>

<p>One of the victims told News 2 he was sitting on his front porch with a friend when two people who appeared to be teenagers started charging at them. One of the suspects had a gun and pointed it at the man, telling him not to do anything stupid.</p>
<p>The victim told News 2 one of the suspects continued to hold the two at gunpoint while the other made sure the keys worked in the car.</p>
<p>People who live and work in the area told News 2 they are hearing more instances of crime reported in the community.</p>
<p>“We work at Vandy and there has been an increase in crime, carjackings, things like that have been happening a lot more than before,” said Sripalla Varam, a researcher at Vanderbilt University.</p>
<p>Vanderbilt campus police believe this incident is related to another attempted carjacking that happened earlier in the evening at 17th Avenue South and Horton Avenue.</p>
<p>Police say in that case, the two teens were unsuccessful in stealing the car.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=wkrn.com&#038;blog=77997908&#038;post=401576&#038;subd=mgtvwkrn&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>GLADEVILLE, Tenn. (WKRN) &#8211; A gun accidentally discharged in a Wilson County church on Easter Sunday. It happened between sermons at The Glade Church in Gladeville.</p>
<p>Thankfully, nobody was injured, but the incident is now under investigation.</p>
<p>Authorities told News 2 a man, who has a carry permit, was attending an Easter service at the Gladeville Baptist church when the gun in his pocket accidentally went off.</p>
<p>The gun was a 9mm glock, and the bullet tore a hole through his pants and shot into the floor.</p>
<p>Pastor Mark Marshall heard the gun shot when it happened around 9 a.m.</p>
<p>“The big picture is nobody was hurt. It was completely an accident on this guy’s part,” Marshall said.</p>
<p>“There are people in the vicinity, so we do believe god protected everyone yesterday,” the pastor added.</p>
<p>According to investigators, there were about 40 to 50 people around when the gun discharged.</p>
<p>While there is a notice prohibiting firearms in the church, Pastor Marshall says several members of the congregation, including law enforcement officers, do carry guns on their person.</p>

<p>Marshall told News 2 the notice is posted for the large number of people who use the church for various reasons all week long.</p>
<p>And while no one was injured, the Wilson County Sheriff’s Department takes the accidental discharge seriously.</p>
<p>“You are legally and ethically responsible for every bullet that comes out of that gun,” said. Lt. Scott Moore.</p>
<p>Sheriff’s officials say the bullet hit the carpet leaving a small mark, but the bullet could have gone anywhere.</p>
<p>“It could happen whenever you discharge a firearm. In this case, accidentally, it could go through his leg, off the floor; it could do anything. You have no control of a bullet once it is fired,” explained Lt. Moore.</p>
<p>The sheriff’s office says how the gun went off in the man’s pocket is unknown.</p>
<p>“Something has to trigger the bullet to be fired out. In a situation like this, not sure if something was in his pocket, but something has to pull the trigger,” the lieutenant told News 2.</p>
<p>The district attorney plans to review the case once the investigation is over. The man could be facing charges or lose his carry permit, but that remains unknown at this time.</p>
<p>His weapon and ammunition were placed into evidence pending the outcome of the case.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=wkrn.com&#038;blog=77997908&#038;post=401401&#038;subd=mgtvwkrn&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>MURFREESBORO, Tenn. (WKRN) – A student at Middle Tennessee State University is now facing animal cruelty charges after a Snapchat video surfaced of a puppy being hit.</p>
<p>Police confirmed to News 2 Monday a warrant was obtained for Shalom Alvarez, 21.</p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/2nNkqku" target="_blank" target="_blank">The Snapchat video was reported sometime last week</a>, prompting an investigation from both the Murfreesboro Police Department and Rutherford County PAWS.</p>
<p>The investigation led to Alvarez and his former teammate Justin Akins being dismissed from MTSU’s football team.</p>
<p>One reportedly took a video of the other hitting a puppy multiple times after it urinated on the floor. In the video, the puppy yelps each time it is hit.</p>
<p>The players apparently told coaches they were simply disciplining the puppy because it had urinated on the floor.</p>
<p>Details of Alvarez’s arrested weren’t immediately released.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=wkrn.com&#038;blog=77997908&#038;post=401642&#038;subd=mgtvwkrn&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>VARNER, Ark. (AP) &#8212; The Arkansas Supreme Court halted the executions of two men originally scheduled to be put to death Monday night, putting another legal roadblock in place in the state&#8217;s plan to conduct eight lethal injections before its supply of a key drug expires at the end of April.</p>
<p>Justices in a 4-3 decision granted stays Monday afternoon for Don Davis and Bruce Ward. The inmates wanted stays of execution while the U.S. Supreme Court takes up a separate case concerning access to independent mental health experts by defendants. The U.S. high court is set to hold oral arguments on April 24.</p>
<p>Three Arkansas justices dissented, with Associate Justice Shawn Womack writing that Ward and Davis &#8220;had their day in court, the jury spoke, and decades of appeals have occurred. The families are entitled to closure and finality of the law.&#8221;</p>
<p>The inmates&#8217; attorneys argued that their clients were denied access to independent mental health experts, saying Ward has a lifelong history of severe mental illness and that Davis has an IQ in the range of intellectual disability.</p>
<p>This was just the latest setback for the state&#8217;s plan to execute eight prisoners before its supply of the sedative midazolam expires at the end of the month. If court proceedings are pushed into May, Arkansas won&#8217;t be able to carry out the executions with the drugs it has on hand.</p>
<p><strong>PREVIOUS: <a href="http://bit.ly/2ovp7wq" target="_blank" target="_blank">Supplier: Drug sold to Arkansas not intended for executions</a></strong></p>
<p>The Arkansas high court already had issued one stay for Ward after a Jefferson County judge said she didn&#8217;t have the authority to halt Ward&#8217;s execution. Ward&#8217;s attorneys have argued he is a diagnosed schizophrenic with no rational understanding of his impending execution.</p>
<p>Also, a federal judge has halted all of the planned executions on different grounds. The state has appealed that ruling to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which hadn&#8217;t weighed in as of mid-afternoon.</p>
<p>The state was still moving forward with plans to conduct the Monday night executions in the event that all stays were lifted. A spokesman for Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge had no immediate comment on the latest stays, saying the office was still reviewing the court&#8217;s order.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Arkansas Supreme Court also barred a state judge who blocked the multiple execution plan from taking up any death penalty related cases after he participated in a protest where he appeared to mimic a death row inmate about to receive a lethal injection. Justices reassigned any death penalty cases from Pulaski County Circuit Court Judge Wendell Griffen, who banned the state from using a lethal injection drug a supplier said was misleadingly obtained. After issuing the order, Griffen participated in an anti-death penalty demonstration where he was strapped to a cot. The high court asked a disciplinary panel to consider whether Griffen violated the code of conduct for judges.</p>
<p>At a federal court hearing last week, prison officials testified they must conduct the executions with their current batch of midazolam, a sedative that is intended to mask the effects of drugs that will shut down the inmates&#8217; lungs and hearts. The inmates say midazolam is unsuitable because it is not a painkiller and could subject them to a cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the U.S. Constitution.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=wkrn.com&#038;blog=77997908&#038;post=401599&#038;subd=mgtvwkrn&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>CLEVELAND (AP) &#8212; In a rambling video, Steve Stephens said, &#8220;I snapped, I just snapped.&#8221; But as the manhunt dragged on Monday for the man <a href="http://wkrn.com/2017/04/16/police-man-showed-slaying-live-on-facebook/" target="_blank">accused of posting Facebook footage of himself killing a Cleveland retiree</a>, police were unable to explain what set him off.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only Steve knows that,&#8221; Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams said as authorities posted a $50,000 reward for Stephens&#8217; capture in the shooting of Robert Godwin Sr., a 74-year-old former foundry worker.</p>
<p>In the video, Stephens blamed a former girlfriend he had lived with, saying he woke up last week and &#8220;couldn&#8217;t take it anymore.&#8221; But in a statement Monday, the woman shed little light on what might have gone wrong and said Stephens was good to her and her children.</p>
<p>As for the shooting victim, Godwin appeared to have been selected at random, gunned down while picking up aluminum cans Sunday afternoon after spending Easter with some of his children.</p>
<p>A manhunt that started in Cleveland&#8217;s gritty east side <a href="http://wkrn.com/2017/04/17/search-widens-for-facebook-murder-suspect/" target="_blank">expanded rapidly into a nationwide search for Stephens</a>, a 37-year-old job counselor who worked with teens and young adults, police said.</p>
<p>&#8220;He could be nearby. He could be far away or anywhere in between,&#8221; FBI agent Stephen Anthony said.</p>

<p>Law enforcement officials said his cellphone signal was last detected on Sunday afternoon in Erie, Pennsylvania, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) east of Cleveland.</p>
<p>Police reported getting dozens and dozens of tips, and nine schools in Philadelphia were locked down Monday while authorities investigated possible sightings of Stephens. But they said there was no sign he was actually there.</p>
<p>Some of those who know Stephens described him as pleasant and kind, while some said he had a gambling problem. He filed for bankruptcy two years ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;He got along with everybody, so it&#8217;s just unbelievable what happened,&#8221; said Alexis Lee, a friend who saw Stephens last week.</p>
<p>The police chief said: &#8220;We are not going to pinpoint a specific thing and say this is what triggered this, because we don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Godwin&#8217;s daughter said he was killed while collecting cans in a plastic shopping bag.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not because he needed the money, it was just something he did,&#8221; said 52-year-old Debbie Godwin. &#8220;That&#8217;s all he was doing. He wasn&#8217;t harming anyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said her father, who had 10 children, was a gentle man with nothing mean about him.</p>
<p>In the shooting video, Stephens told Godwin a woman&#8217;s name and said, &#8220;She&#8217;s the reason that this is about to happen to you.&#8221; The victim did not seem to recognize the woman&#8217;s name. The gunman then pointed a weapon at Godwin, who shielded his face with the plastic bag.</p>
<p>The woman Stephens spoke of, Joy Lane, said in a text to CBS that &#8220;we had been in a relationship for several years. I am sorry that all of this has happened.&#8221; She said Stephens was &#8220;a nice guy&#8221; who was generous to everyone.</p>
<p>The video of the killing was on Facebook for about three hours before it was taken down.</p>
<p>Investigators said that Godwin was the only victim so far linked to Stephens, despite his claim in a separate video on Facebook that he killed over a dozen people.</p>
<p>Detectives spoke with Stephens on Sunday by cellphone and tried to persuade him to surrender, police said.</p>
<p>Stephens worked at Beech Brook, a social service agency in suburban Cleveland that deals with vulnerable young people. He helped them gain job skills and find employment, said Beech Brook spokeswoman Nancy Kortemeyer.</p>
<p>An extensive background check before he was hired turned up nothing worrisome, she said.</p>
<p>Stephens filed for bankruptcy in January 2015. His attorney at the time, Trent Binger, said Monday that he remembered Stephens discussing gambling problems.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was an easy client to deal with,&#8221; Binger said. &#8220;Always respectful to me &#8230; well-mannered.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Associated Press reporters Dake Kang and Delano Massey in Cleveland and John Seewer in Toledo contributed to this report.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=wkrn.com&#038;blog=77997908&#038;post=401587&#038;subd=mgtvwkrn&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ROGERSVILLE, Tenn. (<a href="http://wate.com/2017/04/17/hawkins-county-man-sentenced-to-25-years-for-kidnapping-niece/" target="_blank" target="_blank">WATE</a>) – The Hawkins County man charged with kidnapping a nine-year-old girl and setting off a massive AMBER Alert search pleaded guilty in court on Monday and was sentenced to 25 years in prison.</p>
<p>Gary Simpson entered an Alford plea on Monday, meaning he did not admit to his charges and maintained his innocence, but felt he had no chance of a not guilty verdict.</p>
<p>Simpson must serve 100 percent of his sentence.</p>
<p>Simpson was charged with especially aggravated kidnapping after police say he took his niece by marriage out of school last May. People spent countless hours searching for her and she was finally found in a rural area by three men.</p>
<p>He was later also charged with two counts of rape of a child and three counts of aggravated sexual battery.</p>

<p>PANMUNJOM, South Korea (AP) — A day after a failed North Korean missile test, U.S. President Donald Trump had a message Monday for the North&#8217;s ruler: &#8216;Gotta behave.&#8221; At the same time, Vice President Mike Pence warned at the Korean Demilitarized Zone that America&#8217;s &#8220;era of strategic patience is over.&#8221;</p>
<p>Keeping up the verbal volleying, North Korea&#8217;s deputy U.N. ambassador accused the United States of turning the Korean peninsula into &#8220;the world&#8217;s biggest hotspot&#8221; and creating &#8220;a dangerous situation in which a thermonuclear war may break out at any moment.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://wkrn.com/2017/04/16/pence-visiting-military-camp-near-korean-dmz/" target="_blank">Pence&#8217;s visit to the tense DMZ</a> dividing North and South Korea came at the start of a 10-day trip to Asia and underscored U.S. commitment. It allowed the vice president to gaze at North Korean soldiers afar and stare directly across a border marked by razor wire.</p>
<p>As the bomber jacket-clad vice president was briefed near the military demarcation line, two North Korean soldiers watched from a short distance away, one taking multiple photographs of the American visitor.</p>

<p>Pence told reporters that Trump was hopeful China would use its &#8220;extraordinary levers&#8221; to pressure the North to abandon its weapons program, a day after the North&#8217;s failed missile test launch. But Pence expressed impatience with the unwillingness of the North to move toward ridding itself of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.</p>
<p>Pointing to the quarter-century since the United States first confronted North Korea over its attempts to build nuclear weapons, he said a period of patience had followed.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the era of strategic patience is over,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;President Trump has made it clear that the patience of the United States and our allies in this region has run out and we want to see change. We want to see North Korea abandon its reckless path of the development of nuclear weapons, and also its continual use and testing of ballistic missiles is unacceptable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trump himself appeared to reinforce the message at the White House, replying &#8220;Gotta behave&#8221; when a CNN reporter asked what message he had for North Korean leader Kin Jong Un.</p>
<p>In New York, the North&#8217;s deputy U.N. ambassador, Kim In Ryong, said that U.S.-South Korean military exercises being staged now are the largest-ever &#8220;aggressive war drill.&#8221; He said his country &#8220;is ready to react to any mode of war desired by the U.S.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, speaking to reporters Monday evening, said he hoped there would be &#8220;no unilateral actions like those we saw recently in Syria and that the U.S. will follow the line that President Trump repeatedly voiced during the election campaign.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, China made a plea for a return to negotiations. Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said tensions need to be eased on the Korean Peninsula to bring the escalating dispute there to a peaceful resolution. Lu said Beijing wants to resume the multi-party negotiations that ended in stalemate in 2009 and suggested that U.S. plans to deploy a missile defense system in South Korea were damaging its relations with China.</p>
<p>Late Monday, Pence reiterated in a joint statement alongside South Korean Acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn that &#8220;all options are on the table&#8221; and said any use of nuclear weapons by Pyongyang would be met with &#8220;an overwhelming and effective response.&#8221; He said the American commitment to South Korea is &#8220;iron-clad and immutable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Noting Trump&#8217;s recent military actions in Syria and Afghanistan, Pence said, &#8220;North Korea would do well not to test his resolve&#8221; or the U.S. armed forces in the region.</p>
<p>The vice president earlier visited a military installation near the DMZ, Camp Bonifas, for a briefing with military leaders at the joint U.S.-South Korean installation, which is just outside the 2.5-mile wide (4 kilometers) DMZ. Under rainfall, Pence later stood a few meters from the military demarcation line outside Freedom House, gazing at the North Korean soldiers across the border, and then peered at a deforested stretch of North Korea from a lookout post in the hillside.</p>
<p>In Tokyo, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, speaking to a parliamentary session Monday, said: &#8220;Needless to say, diplomatic effort is important to maintain peace. But dialogue for the sake of having dialogue is meaningless.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to apply pressure on North Korea so they seriously respond to a dialogue&#8221; with the international community, he said, urging China and Russia to play more constructive roles on the issue.</p>
<p>Pence&#8217;s visit came amid increasing tensions and heated rhetoric on the Korean Peninsula. While the North did not conduct a nuclear test, the specter of a potential test and an escalated U.S. response has trailed Pence as he undertakes his Asian tour.</p>
<p>The Trump administration is hoping that China will help rein in North Korea in exchange for other considerations. Last week, Trump said he would not declare China a currency manipulator, pulling back from a campaign promise, as he looked for help from Beijing, which is the North&#8217;s dominant trade partner.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=wkrn.com&#038;blog=77997908&#038;post=401565&#038;subd=mgtvwkrn&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>WHITE COUNTY, Tenn. (WKRN) – The widow of a Clarksville man <a href="http://wkrn.com/2017/04/13/tbi-responds-to-officer-involved-shooting-in-white-county/" target="_blank">killed in last week’s White County officer-involved shooting</a> said her husband died from a gunshot wound to the head.</p>
<p>Michael Zennie Dial II, 33, was found dead after a crash Thursday afternoon following a police chase from DeKalb County into White County.</p>
<p>During the 17-mile chase, Dial is accused of ramming several police law enforcement vehicles. Three officers were injured and taken to local hospitals with non-life threatening injuries.</p>
<p>When the tires on Dial’s pickup truck flattened and items starting falling from an attached trailer, the TBI said one officer with the Sparta Police Department and one deputy with the White County Sheriff’s Office fired shots at the truck in an attempt to get it to stop.</p>

<p>That’s when Dial’s truck went off the road, down an embankment and stopped in a tree line. Dial was pronounced dead.</p>
<p>His wife, Robyn Spainhoward, said she spoke with the Medical Examiner’s Office on Monday.</p>
<p>“He was shot in the head and that’s what killed him,” Spainhoward said of the conversation.</p>
<p>Spainhoward said her husband was in DeKalb County to set up for a flea market, but she was not sure what led up to the chase.</p>
<p>“Why fire shots? Why shoot?” Spainhoward said. “Don’t they have those things they throw down, they have nails in to pop your tires? Why would they have to shoot him?”</p>
<p>The TBI has not released Dial’s official cause of death.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=wkrn.com&#038;blog=77997908&#038;post=401542&#038;subd=mgtvwkrn&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WKRN) – Kyle Hankins, better known as Krazy Kyle, has a special job at the Bridgestone Arena. He’s the man behind the organ at every Predators home game.</p>
<p>“It’s the best job in the whole entire world,” he told News 2. “That’s what it is, you use your musical skills. I do stuff that’s exciting, maybe fun, off-center a little bit, but just try to make people stay engaged during the hockey game and that is what it’s all about.”</p>

<p>Not only does he have the &#8220;best job in the world,&#8221; but Krazy Kyle also has the perfect view of the game and is surrounded by fans during all three periods.</p>
<p>“Where I’m at, I’m on the north side of the arena and I’m right behind Pekka Rinne for two of his periods. [It’s] absolutely fantastic. The playoff run, here’s a special to be here with the team and see what they’re doing. Anytime you can go to a playoff it’s unbelievable. The intensity of the crowd, the volume, everything is so charged and dynamic. Probably the best place to be,” he said.</p>
<p>Kyle said he often gets requests from fans and he tries to fill as many of those as he possibly can.</p>
<p>“People yell at me requests, people <a href="https://twitter.com/krazykylepreds" target="_blank" target="_blank">send me tweets</a>. I try to squeeze in as many requests as possible,” he said.</p>
<p>The Nashville Predators take on the Blackhawks in Game 3 at the Bridgestone Arena Monday at 8:30 p.m.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Opening his first White House Easter Egg Roll, President Donald Trump extolled the strength of America as thousands of kids, and some adults, reveled in the time-honored tradition of rolling hard-boiled eggs across the manicured lawn in his back yard.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the 139th Easter Egg Roll. Think of it, 139,&#8221; Trump said Monday, welcoming families to the annual event, which was dampened by intermittent rain. &#8220;And we will be stronger and bigger and better as a nation than ever before. We&#8217;re right on track,&#8221; he said, speaking of the nation&#8217;s strength under fewer than 100 days of his leadership.</p>
<p>Trump&#8217;s wife, Melania, and their son, Barron, 11, and the Easter Bunny joined him on a balcony overlooking the expansive lawn before they went downstairs to join some of the 21,000 people who were expected to attend what is the biggest social event every year at the White House.</p>
<p>Before joining the festivities with his family, Trump thanked his wife for &#8220;working on this for a long time to make it perfect.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was, however, some speculation about whether the Trumps would be able to pull off a successful &#8220;egg-stravaganza.&#8221; Planning seemed to get off to a late start, with the Trumps taking longer than in previous years to announce Monday&#8217;s date.</p>
<p>Both Trump and the first lady have been slow to fill White House jobs, and at least one regular egg roll vendor took to Twitter, the president&#8217;s favorite social medium, to remind the White House that a deadline for ordering the wooden eggs that are given out as souvenirs was approaching.</p>
<p>But the egg rolling event, which dates to 1878, wouldn&#8217;t be made to disappear. It was just made smaller, down from the 35,000 people who got tickets last year, but retaining such activities as a reading nook, an area to send messages to U.S. troops and an entertainment stage.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we renew this tradition, thank you for joining us,&#8221; the first lady said.</p>
<p>Moments later, Trump blew a whistle three times, each time sending groups of youngsters scurrying to deftly use a wooden spoon to maneuver their dyed egg several yards across the finish line. He, the first lady and Barron also joined kids at a table to color cards to send to U.S. service members.</p>
<p>Trump&#8217;s older sons, Don Jr. and Eric, and their wives, and daughter Tiffany also attended.</p>
<p>Seven-year-old Johnny Wilmer of Arlington, Virginia, said his egg-rolling effort ended with a second-place finish. It was his first Easter egg roll, and he said while he and his father, Jack, waited for Trump to appear that the experience had been &#8220;great.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over at the reading area, Mrs. Trump read &#8220;Party Animals,&#8221; a story about celebrating differences written by television personality Kathie Lee Gifford.</p>
<p>Costumed characters roaming the grounds included Elmo from &#8220;Sesame Street,&#8221; Dr. Seuss&#8217; Cat in the Hat, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and some of the Racing Presidents, who are mascots for the Washington Nationals of Major League Baseball.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=wkrn.com&#038;blog=77997908&#038;post=401530&#038;subd=mgtvwkrn&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WKRN) &#8211; A registered sex offender was arrested at a Nashville church on Sunday just before an Easter service.</p>
<p>According to an arrest affidavit, Metro police got word that William Frankenbach was at Christ the Cathedral Church on Belmont Boulevard.</p>
<p>The 38-year-old allegedly had an outstanding warrant for violating sex offender registry requirements and is prohibited from being around children.</p>
<p>The arresting officer wrote in an affidavit that Frankenbach was standing in the corner of the sanctuary, out of view of most people, while many children and teens were present.</p>
<p>Frankenbach was convicted in 2014 of sexual solicitation of a minor.</p>
<p>He faces two felony charges for failing to possess identification as a sex offender and unlawfully occupying property near children. His first court appearance was set for Wednesday.</p>

<p>“I have a ton of respect for Jason and what he has meant for this team and accomplished in our community in his eight years with the Titans,” General Manager Jon Robinson said.</p>

We talked about having him back this season, but neither side could find the right solution, so we are each going our different ways. I want to thank him on behalf of the organization for his time here in Tennessee.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A doctor who saw Prince in the days before he died had prescribed the opioid painkiller oxycodone under the name of Prince&#8217;s friend to protect the musician&#8217;s privacy, according to court documents unsealed Monday that revealed nothing about how the pop superstar got the fentanyl that actually killed him.</p>
<p>The affidavits and search warrants were unsealed in Carver County District Court as the yearlong investigation into Prince&#8217;s death continues. The documents show authorities searched Paisley Park, cellphone records of Prince&#8217;s associates, and Prince&#8217;s email accounts to try to determine how he got the fentanyl, a synthetic opioid drug 50 times more powerful than heroin.</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t reveal answers, but do shed light on Prince&#8217;s struggle with addiction to prescription opioids in the days before he died. Oxycodone, the generic name for the active ingredient in OxyContin, was not listed as a cause of Prince&#8217;s death. But it is part of a family of painkillers driving the nation&#8217;s overdose and addiction epidemic, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nearly 2 million Americans abused or were addicted to prescription opioids, including oxycodone, in 2014.</p>
<p><strong>PHOTOS: <a href="http://interactives.wkrn.com/photomojo/gallery/41339/1/" target="_blank">Remembering Prince (1958-2016)</a></strong></p>
<p>Patients who take prescription opioids eventually build up a tolerance and need to take stronger doses to get the same effect. In some patients, the cycle leads to dependence and addiction.</p>
<p>Prince was 57 when he was found alone and unresponsive in an elevator at his Paisley Park home on April 21.</p>
<p>Just six days earlier, Prince fell ill on a plane and made an emergency stop in Illinois as he was returning home from a concert in Atlanta. First responders revived him with two doses of a drug that reverses the effects of an opioid overdose.</p>
<p>A search of Prince&#8217;s home yielded numerous pills in various containers. Some were in prescription bottles for Kirk Johnson, Prince&#8217;s longtime friend and associate. Some pills in other bottles were marked &#8220;Watson 853,&#8221; a label used for a drug that is a mix of acetaminophen and hydrocodone, another opioid painkiller. Last August, an official with knowledge of the investigation told The Associated Press that at least one of those pills tested positive for fentanyl, meaning the pill was counterfeit and obtained illegally. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation.</p>
<p>In addition to the dozens of pills recovered, authorities also found a pamphlet for an addiction recovery center in California, the documents unsealed Monday show. The day before Prince died, Paisley Park staffers contacted the California addiction specialist as they were trying to get Prince help.</p>
<p>One affidavit says Dr. Michael Todd Schulenberg, a family doctor who saw Prince April 7, 2016, and again on April 20, acknowledged to authorities that he prescribed oxycodone for Prince the same day as the emergency plane landing &#8220;but put the prescription in Kirk Johnson&#8217;s name for Prince&#8217;s privacy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Authorities also searched Johnson&#8217;s cellphone records, to see who he was communicating with in the month before Prince died.</p>
<p>Messages left with attorneys for Schulenberg and Johnson weren&#8217;t immediately returned Monday. Schulenberg has an active medical license and is currently practicing family medicine in Minnesota. His attorney, Amy Conners, told the AP last week that there are no restrictions on his license.</p>
<p>Investigators haven&#8217;t interviewed either Johnson or Schulenberg since the hours after Prince died, an official with knowledge of the investigation told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing.</p>
<p>While authorities have the power to ask a grand jury to investigate and issue subpoenas for testimony, that step hasn&#8217;t been taken, the official said.</p>
<p>Prince did not have a cellphone, and authorities searched multiple email accounts that belonged to him, as they tried to determine who he was communicating with and where he got the drugs that killed him, according to the search warrants. The search warrants don&#8217;t reveal the outcome of the email searches.</p>
<p>The documents say some of the drugs in Prince&#8217;s bedroom were in a suitcase with the name &#8220;Peter Bravestrong&#8221; on it. Police believe Bravestrong was an alias that Prince used when he traveled. The suitcase also contained lyrics for the song &#8220;U Got the Look&#8221; that appeared to be in Prince&#8217;s handwriting.</p>
<p>The day before Prince died, Paisley Park staffers contacted California addiction specialist Dr. Howard Kornfeld for help. Kornfeld sent his son, Andrew, to Minnesota that night, and the younger Kornfeld was among those who found Prince&#8217;s body.</p>
<p>Andrew Kornfeld was carrying buprenorphine, a medication that can be used to help treat opioid addiction. The Kornfelds&#8217; attorney, William Mauzy, has said Andrew had intended to give the medication to a doctor who planned to see Prince on April 21.</p>
<p>Investigators have said little about the case over the last year, other than it is active. The official who spoke to the AP said the case has taken investigators to Illinois and California, as authorities have interviewed friends, family and any potential witnesses, including the flight crew and hospital staff that were present when Prince overdosed on the plane.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WKRN) – A former licensed counselor faces charges after an investigation by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation revealed she allegedly billed for services that were not provided.</p>
<p>The TBI began investigating Thelma Dees-Johnson, a license practical counselor, on Oct. 26, 2011. During the course of the investigation, agents developed information that over a period of several years Dees-Johnson submitted claims to TennCare for counseling services she did not perform.</p>
<p>On several occasions, the investigation revealed Johnson was not present at her office on the days for which services were billed.</p>
<p>In 2015, she dissolved the company, Bridgeway Mental Health Services, and moved to Florida.</p>
<p>Last month, a grand jury indicted Dees-Johnson with one count of TennCare fraud over $60,000.</p>
<p>She was booked into the Davidson County jail on a $25,000 bond.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=wkrn.com&#038;blog=77997908&#038;post=401493&#038;subd=mgtvwkrn&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>
